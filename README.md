# Tricky Algorithms in C

## Introduction
Welcome to the *Tricky Algorithms in C* repository! This collection is dedicated to showcasing complex and intriguing algorithms implemented in C, focusing on demonstrating intricate algorithmic concepts and efficient problem-solving techniques.

## Algorithms Overview
Each algorithm in this repository is crafted to address unique challenges, emphasizing the depth and intricacies of algorithmic design in C. These implementations are not just about problem-solving; they explore optimization, innovation, and the subtleties of algorithmic thinking.

### List of Algorithms
- **Monty Hall roblem**: The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle where you choose one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, knowing what's behind each door, opens another door revealing no prize. You then decide whether to stick with your initial choice or switch to the remaining closed door. Counterintuitively, switching doors gives you a higher chance (2/3) of winning the prize, compared to sticking with your initial choice (1/3).

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites
- A C compiler (such as GCC) is required.
- Basic understanding of C programming and command-line operations is assumed.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbdullahAydn/TrickyAlgorithms.git
```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
3. 
```bash
cd TrickyAlgorithms
```

### Compiling and Running
To compile an algorithm, use the following command (replace `algorithm_name.c` with the actual file name):

```bash
gcc -o algorithm_name algorithm_name.c
```

To execute the compiled program:

```bash
./algorithm_name
```
